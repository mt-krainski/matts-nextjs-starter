This is a modern next.js project using:
- typescript
- supabase
- shadcn/ui for components - always add necessary components using the shadcn/ui CLI

# Important Rules to follow
- keep the code clean and readable, keep comments to a minimum. Prefer clean code to verbose comments
- never generate documentation files unless explicitly asked for
- never, under any circumstances, don't grep the .env file. Ask the user to provide the value if needed.
